<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I'm a full stack and software developer with a deep excitement for AI.  The combination of logic, analysis, technology and, at the same 
  creating art with numbers and codes is what drives my passion for this path.</p>

<p>After many years of working in the  hospitality industry, which brought pleasant moments, experiences, and knowledge, I realized that a
   new challenge was so much needed. Now you can find me constantly learning while developing new projects, and when I'm not doing that working
    out, drawing and being with my cat are part of my day.</p>
